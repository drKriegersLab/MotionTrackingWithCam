MotionTrackingWithCam

You can find the built program in DropBox, here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ecuh79gawbt3tmc/AACEMYHx1ZRBZvt43PN7yzi9a?dl=0

In the MotionTracking folder, you will find some sample files. There are some calibration results (in txt files) for webcamera and for my DSLR camera (with different resolutions and chessboards). Beside to them, there are sample video files, and output video files, which with you will see, how the program works. 

If you want to use the program, first, you need to calibrate your camera with the calib module. You can use the chessboard examples I copied to the calib folder. After that, you can give the calibration result to the MotionTracking program. You can start the program from windows console. If you us the "--help" argument, you will find more information about the usage of both application. (how to specify the calibration or input/output video file paths etc.)
